# SAP CAP Digital Assistant Architecture Document

## Overview
This document outlines the system architecture for the SAP CAP application designed to function as a digital assistant, answering user queries in natural language using SAP AI services and featuring an intuitive frontend with SAP UI5/Fiori.

## Components
- **Node.js**: Utilized for developing the CAP application backend.
- **xsuaa**: Manages authentication and authorization within the SAP ecosystem.
- **MTA (Multi-Target Application)**: Used for packaging the application and its components.
- **App Router**: Handles routing and acts as an entry point to the application.
- **SAP HANA**: Serves as the primary database, ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **SAP AI Core**: Provides AI capabilities, including natural language processing, for the application.
- **SAP Cloud Foundry**: Hosts the application and facilitates deployment.
- **SAP UI5/Fiori**: Delivers a user-friendly frontend similar to popular chat applications.
- **wdio (WebdriverIO)**: Used for end-to-end testing to ensure functionality and performance.
